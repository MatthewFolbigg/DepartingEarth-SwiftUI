# DepartingEarth
### About
Departing Earth is a iOS app that displays details about upcoming space launches from multiple providers. 
Upcoming launch data is provided by [Launch Library 2](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi) created by [The Space Devs](https://thespacedevs.com). 
This is a new version of my original DepartingEarth project, completely rebuilt using SwiftUI for the purpose of leaning more about SwiftUI.

## Built With
* Swift 5
* Xcode 13.1
* iOS 15.0
* SwiftUI
* Launch Library 2
